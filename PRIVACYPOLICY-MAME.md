MaMe AI – Privacy Policy and Terms of Use
Privacy Policy
When you interact with MaMe AI, the responses (“Outputs”) are generated based on the text you submit (“Prompts”).

We do not store your Prompts or Outputs on external servers. Instead, recent chats are saved locally on your device (unless you opt out), to maximize your privacy.

You can delete individual chats using the delete icon or clear all recent chats via your browser settings. Recent chats are automatically removed after 30 conversations. Note: some browsers may automatically delete local data if MaMe AI is not accessed for a period of time.

Before Prompts are sent to underlying AI model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc.), all personal metadata (such as your IP address) is removed. However, if you include personal information within your Prompts, it may be reflected in the Outputs. Neither MaMe AI nor our model providers can identify you personally from the input.

We have strict agreements in place with all model providers:

Your personal data (like IP address) is never shared with them.

They are prohibited from using your Prompts and Outputs to train or improve their models.

They must delete all request data within 30 days (or sooner), except where legally required to retain it for safety or compliance.

This policy works alongside our general Privacy Policy. In the event of a conflict, this specific MaMe AI Privacy Policy takes precedence.

Terms of Service
You retain all rights to the content you submit.
We do not claim ownership of your Prompts or Outputs. By using MaMe AI, you grant us a limited license to process your input and provide you with Outputs in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

You agree that you have the right to use any personal or third-party data included in your Prompts.

Important Notes on Outputs
Outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated. You should not rely on them without independent verification, especially in sensitive areas (e.g., legal, financial, medical).

MaMe AI is not responsible for errors or misuse of Outputs, including in coding or development contexts.

Outputs do not reflect the views or opinions of MaMe AI.

Age Requirement
MaMe AI is only available to users aged 13 or older. If you’re under the age of majority in your region, you must have a parent or guardian’s consent.

Permitted Use Only
You may not use MaMe AI for:

Illegal, harmful, harassing, or deceptive purposes.

Violating the privacy, intellectual property, or legal rights of others.

Generating spam, malware, or accessing systems without authorization.

Creating or promoting explicit, violent, or dangerous content (e.g., weapons, gambling, etc.).

Regulated domains like legal, financial, or medical services, or for decision-making in employment, housing, or government policy.

Model providers enforce safety mechanisms to block inappropriate Prompts and Outputs.

Enforcement and Liability
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless MaMe AI, its affiliates, and partners against any legal claims arising from your use of the service or the misuse of Outputs.

We may suspend or terminate access to MaMe AI at any time if you violate these Terms.

If these Terms are updated, we will post the new version at mame.ai/privacy-terms and note the date of the latest update. Continued use constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
